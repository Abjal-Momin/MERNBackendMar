MERN
Backend - Express.js
Runtime Environment - Node.js

<!-- 1. JavaScript on both Client and Server. -->
<!-- 2. Non-blocking I/O Model. -->
<!-- 3. Huge Ecosystem (NPM) -->
<!-- 4. Fast Execution with V8 Engine -->

<!-- Interactive Node with REPL -->

<!-- REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print-Loop -->
<!-- 1. Quick Experimentation -->
<!-- 2. Debugging Snippets -->
<!-- 3. Learning JavaScript/Node.js Features -->
<!-- 4. Testing small code pieces before adding to files -->




<!-- Node.js Architecture -->

( Your App (JS Code) ) ======> JS Code or a Program
( Node.js Bindings ) =======> Bridge b/w JS code and Lower-parts of Node.js
( V8 Engine (Chrome) ) =======> Executes the JS Code.
( Libuv (Event Loop) ) =======> 1. Event loop (async operations)
=====> 2. Thread Pool (handles heavy tasks)
( Operating System (OS) ) =======> Actual Low-level operations.


<!-- Web Server: Web Application Architecture -->
Web Server is a software that handles the HTTP requests and serves respones.

<!-- http Module- creating servers and making HTTP requests. -->
=> Client-Server Model.
=> Request-Response Cycle.
=> Common HTTP Methods - GET, POST, DELETE, PUT (CRUD)
